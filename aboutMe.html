            <p><strong>I am 16 years old and I attend the High School of Fashion Industries, also known as HSFI. In this coming school year I will be a junior. Some hobbies of mine include dancing, giving advice to my friends, watching Netflix and Hulu, reading stories on Wattpad and Episode, and playing video games or mobile games. My favorite subjects in school included Earth Science and Global, my least favorite subject would be Geometry. In my future I plan on going to colleges where I can major in either Psychology or Sociology because I find it interesting to learn about people by observing and interpreting their emotions, behavior patterns, and social processes. I love going to Los Angeles, Calafornia, Six Flags, Disney World, Hershey Park, Myrtle Beach, Coney Island, and Dorney Park. </strong></p>
