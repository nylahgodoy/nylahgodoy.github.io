    <p id="color">Hey, my name is Nylah and I’m 17. In this website you’ll be learning all about me. First, I’m going to start off by telling you some of my favorite things. My favorite color is purple, I don’t know why but ever since I was young that’s always just been a color I was drawn to. My favorite number is 8, probably because I was born on the 8th. my favorite Youtubers are the Dolan twins. <a href="https://youtu.be/mC4dqjA5MiA"> <strong> WATCH, LIKE, AND SUBSCRIBE </strong>. </a> In the past two- three years I was lucky enough to meet them. Some hobbies of mine include <em> dancing, singing </em>(even though I’m not good at it, lol), <em> and giving people advice. </em>

  	<p>I go to <strong> the High School of fashion industries </strong> and I’m currently a rising senior. Meaning, college is right around the corner and I’ll have to figure out what I want to do with my life. Currently I have some ideas as to what that might look like, I want to go in college majoring psychology and minoring in either business or marketing. All of the colleges are in upstate New York because I don’t want to be too far from home, but I would still like to have the experience of living on my own. Some colleges I would like to go to include...</p>
      <li><em>Skidmore University</em></li>
      <li><em>U Albany</em></li>
      <li><em>Binghamton University</em></li>
      <li><em>Ithaca University</em></li>

    <p>Enough about college though, time to tell you more about my life in High School. In my school there are different majors that you can go into, fashion, art, or business; I chose business because I suck at drawing and I don’t have the patience to sit and sow. So far I’ve taken intro to marketing, finance literacy, business law, computer applications, and another marketing class.</p>
